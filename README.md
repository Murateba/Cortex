  Cortex leverages a C/C++ based offline AI module (powered by Llama.cpp) that runs directly on your device. This mode ensures maximum data privacy, as all processing occurs locally without sending data to cloud servers.

### Online Mode
- **Server-Powered AI:**  
  For users with internet connectivity, Cortex provides access to advanced AI models hosted on scalable server infrastructure. Communication with these models is secured via TLS, ensuring data protection.

### Customization & Personalization
- **Model Uploads:**  
  Users with Plus Membership can upload and manage their own AI models, tailoring the experience to their needs.
- **Interactive Characters:**  
  The app offers diverse AI personas that you can interact with through text and voice.
- **Future Enhancements:**  
  Cortex is planning to introduce AI Agent capabilities, enabling the app to automate complex tasks independently.
